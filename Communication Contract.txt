Instructions for how to REQUEST data:

The user will call getVehicleJSON(method_name, args = []) in python where method_name is the name of the method and args is the list of strings that represents the arguments for an API method. The correct format for method_name is as followed. Case and spacing does not matter. The names of the API Methods (found here: https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/) will work with most cases except for when the names of the API Methods are longer than their URL-method-name-segment equivalent. For example: "Get Vehicle Types for Make by ID" method is called with "Get Vehicle Types For Make Id" (no by). When in doubt consult the urls for the API method calls. Another confusing one is "Get Makes for Manufacturer by Manufacturer Name," which is called with "Get Make for Manufacturer" ('Make' is singular in the request call). Also for Get Models for Make and a combination of Year and Vehicle Type, the order must be make, model year, vehicle type.

Instructions for how to RECEIVE data:

Once the request has been sent successfully, the calling method will return the JSON object with the appropriate data. It is then up to the user to do what they wish with this JSON object. If the request failed, an error will occur.
